## Breaking changes

- The `BasicError` type was removed since it has the same properties as the `BasicResponse` type. This changes the signatures of the following methods:
  - `AccountsEndpoint.GetAccount()` now returns `Task<NordigenApiResponse<BankAccount, BasicResponse>>` instead of `Task<NordigenApiResponse<BankAccount, BasicError>>`
  - `AgreementsEndpoint.GetAgreements()` now returns `Task<NordigenApiResponse<ResponsePage<Agreement>, BasicResponse>>` instead of `Task<NordigenApiResponse<ResponsePage<Agreement>, BasicError>>`
  - `AgreementsEndpoint.GetAgreement()` now returns `Task<NordigenApiResponse<Agreement, BasicResponse>>` instead of `Task<NordigenApiResponse<Agreement, BasicError>>`
  - `AgreementsEndpoint.DeleteAgreement()` now returns `Task<NordigenApiResponse<BasicResponse, BasicResponse>>` instead of `Task<NordigenApiResponse<BasicResponse, BasicError>>`
  - `AgreementsEndpoint.AcceptAgreement()` now returns `Task<NordigenApiResponse<Agreement, BasicResponse>>` instead of `Task<NordigenApiResponse<Agreement, BasicError>>`
  - `InstitutionsEndpoint.GetInstitution()` now returns `Task<NordigenApiResponse<Institution, BasicResponse>>` instead of `Task<NordigenApiResponse<Institution, BasicError>>`
  - `RequisitionsEndpoint.GetRequisitions()` now returns `Task<NordigenApiResponse<ResponsePage<Requisition>, BasicResponse>>` instead of `Task<NordigenApiResponse<ResponsePage<Requisition>, BasicError>>`
  - `RequisitionsEndpoint.GetRequisition()` now returns `Task<NordigenApiResponse<Requisition, BasicResponse>>` instead of `Task<NordigenApiResponse<Requisition, BasicError>>`
  - `RequisitionsEndpoint.DeleteRequisition()` now returns `Task<NordigenApiResponse<BasicResponse, BasicResponse>>` instead of `Task<NordigenApiResponse<BasicResponse, BasicError>>`
  - `TokenEndpoint.GetTokenPair()` now returns `Task<NordigenApiResponse<JsonWebTokenPair, BasicResponse>>` instead of `Task<NordigenApiResponse<JsonWebTokenPair, BasicError>>`
  - `TokenEndpoint.RefreshAccessToken()` now returns `Task<NordigenApiResponse<JsonWebAccessToken, BasicResponse>>` instead of `Task<NordigenApiResponse<JsonWebAccessToken, BasicError>>`
- The `InstitutionsError` type has been removed and replaced by `BasicResponse` since the error can in all cases be simplified to this type. This changes the signatures of the following method:
  - `InstitutionsEndpoint.GetInstitutions()` now returns `Task<NordigenApiResponse<List<Institution>, BasicResponse>>` instead of `Task<NordigenApiResponse<List<Institution>, InstitutionsError>>`
- Introduced the following exceptions:
  - `AccountsEndpoint.GetTransactions()` now immediately throws an `ArgumentException` when the `endDate` argument contains a date before `startDate` instead of executing the response, since this will always result in an error being returned by the API
  - `JsonWebTokenPair` and `NordigenClientCredentials` now throw an `ArgumentNullException` when the supplied `string` arguments are `null`
- Multiple changes to the `Institution` type:
  - Changed the type of the `TransactionTotalDays` property from `int` to `uint` since this value can't be negative
  - Added the following new properties:
    - `SupportedPayments`: The supported payment products for this institution (e.g. `SepaCreditTransfers`, `SwiftPaymentService`, etc.)
    - `SupportedFeatures`: The supported features for this institution (e.g. `account_selection`, `card_accounts`, etc.). This can inform you which features you can use when creating a requisition with an institution.
    - `IdentificationCodes`: Undocumented field in the response model
- Changed properties of type `IEnumerable` to `List` since most where already returning `List` and to bring them in line. This affects the following properties:
  - `ResponsePage.Results`
  - `Tranasction.RemittanceInformationUnstructuredArray`
  - `Transaction.RemittanceInformationStructuredArray`
  - `Transaction.CurrencyExchange`

## Miscellaneous

- When the client can't acquire a valid access token needed for authenticated requests it won't try to execute any subsequent request anymore (if they require authentication). Instead the error returned by the authentication request is returned immediately. The previous behavior was to execute the subsequent request which would return a more generic authentication error.
- The `TokenPairUpdated` event is now only raised when the token was successfully updated. In the past it was also raised for unsuccessful token refreshes. Therefore the `TokenPairUpdatedEventArgsJsonWebTokenPair` property is now no longer nullable.
- Fixed a multitude of errors not being correctly deserialized due to erratic API response models
