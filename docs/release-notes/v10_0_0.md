## Breaking Changes

### `InstitutionsEndpoint` class

The signature of the method `GetInstitutions` changed. The argument `readDebtorAccountSupported` was newly added.

#### v9.0.0

```csharp
public async Task<NordigenApiResponse<List<Institution>, BasicResponse>> GetInstitutions(string? country = null,
        bool? accessScopesSupported = null, bool? accountSelectionSupported = null,
        bool? businessAccountsSupported = null, bool? cardAccountsSupported = null,
        bool? corporateAccountsSupported = null, bool? privateAccountsSupported = null,
        bool? readRefundAccountSupported = null, bool? paymentsEnabled = null, bool? paymentSubmissionSupported = null,
        bool? pendingTransactionsSupported = null, bool? ssnVerificationSupported = null,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
```

#### v10.0.0

```csharp
public async Task<NordigenApiResponse<List<Institution>, BasicResponse>> GetInstitutions(string? country = null,
        bool? accessScopesSupported = null, bool? accountSelectionSupported = null,
        bool? businessAccountsSupported = null, bool? cardAccountsSupported = null,
        bool? corporateAccountsSupported = null, bool? privateAccountsSupported = null,
        bool? readRefundAccountSupported = null, bool? readDebtorAccountSupported = null,
        bool? paymentsEnabled = null, bool? paymentSubmissionSupported = null,
        bool? pendingTransactionsSupported = null, bool? ssnVerificationSupported = null,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
```

### `NordigenClient` class

The `TokenPairUpdated` event is now raised whenever the `JsonWebTokenPair` property is successfully updated. Not only when it was automatically updated but also when done so by the user.
