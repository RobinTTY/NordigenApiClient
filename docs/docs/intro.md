This library provides a .NET client for
the [GoCardless Bank Account Data API](https://gocardless.com/bank-account-data/). The name NordigenApiClient is due to the API being formerly offered by the company Nordigen, before [being acquired by GoCardless](https://gocardless.com/g/gc-nordigen/).

The following API endpoints are supported:

- Token
- Institutions
- Agreements
- Requisitions
- Accounts

The fastest way to get started is to follow the [Quickstart guide](quickstart-guide). Of course you can also find a detailed description of all capabilities of the client in this documentation. The official GoCardless documentation for the API can be found [here](https://developer.gocardless.com/bank-account-data/overview).
