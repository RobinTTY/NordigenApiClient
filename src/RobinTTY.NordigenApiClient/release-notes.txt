THIS UPDATE CONTAINS BREAKING CHANGES TO THE API SURFACE! PLEASE READ THE CHANGE NOTES BEFORE UPGRADING!

This update provides strongly typed responses where in the past only strings were returned, to improve ease of use.
The new strongly typed properties are part of the `BankAccountDetails` class and are as follows:

- `CashAccountType` enum for the `CashAccountType` property
- `BankAccountUsage` enum for the `Usage` property
- `IsoBankAccountStatus` enum for the `Status` property

Additionally the `AmountParsed` property has been remove from the `AmountCurrencyPair` class. Instead the `Amount` property is now of type decimal.
The same change has been made in the `CurrencyExchange` class (`ExchangeRateParsed` property removed, `ExchangeRate` now of type decimal).
These changes have been made to provide a more consistent API surface without any "unparsed" information. Where possible the returned information is now always converted into a concrete type.

The nullability of some properties has also been corrected.
